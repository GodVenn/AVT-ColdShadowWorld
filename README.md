# AVT-ColdShadowWorld
Our goal will be to create a nice-looking world with procedurally generated terrain, gucci shading, snow and shadows. We want to explore the world using some flying device which has a HUD. We will strive to have a realistic terrain, although we have not yet decided which geographic type of terrain it will be.
